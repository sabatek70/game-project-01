[CLOSED] This is a small game project in raylib using C++. 6-7 Hours in. The project has been ditched, due to a massive skill-issue i.e. lack of experience, horrible organization and big gaps in knowledge.

Things to do differently next time:
  - "m_" name convention for member variables?
  - putting this-> everywhere certainly does not help in making the code clearer and more understandable lmao
  - choosing a better fit of a system and class strucure, in this case it was a poor excuse for classes based on attributes
  - spend way more time on designing the systems and game, writing the code should be mostly doing what's planned, not thinking about how to do it and just make it work...
  - learn to code properly, structure and programming theory.
